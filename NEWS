  - lsm.basis.clm and lsm.basis.clmm removed (now dealt in a much powerful manner by the 'lsmeans' package)

  - fc.multcomp removed (comparison of slopes dealt in a much powerful manner by the 'lsmeans' package)
  - plot1comp.ind rewritten to display a more easy-to-interpret graph
  - byf.normhist removed (not very useful and nearly same thing now done by byf.hist)
