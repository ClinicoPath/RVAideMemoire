version 0.9-41 (15-11-2014)
  - lsm.basis.clm and lsm.basis.clmm removed (now dealt in a much powerful manner by the 'lsmeans' package)
  - DA.var removed (the MVA.synt function of this package does the same job and is more generic)
  - fc.multcomp removed (comparison of slopes dealt in a much powerful manner by the 'lsmeans' package)
  - plot1comp.ind rewritten to display a more easy-to-interpret graph
  - byf.normhist removed (not very useful and nearly same thing now done by byf.hist)
  - MVA.synt extended to MCA and mixed analyses

version 0.9-45 (13-03-2015)
  - histograms with density polygons improved
  - G.test, G.multcomp and G.theo.multcomp modified to deal with 0 values (but warning that it should not be done)
  - new functions multinomial.test, multinomial.multcomp and multinomial.theo.multcomp (exact multinomial goodness-of-fit test and pairwise comparisons)
  - chisq.bintest splitted into chisq.bintest and fisher.bintest (chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for comparing response probabilities)
  - new function G.bintest (G test for comparing response probabilities)
  - new functions chisq.theo.bintest, chisq.bin.exp and prop.bin.multcomp (comparison of response probabilities to theoretical values)
  - new function fp.test (Fligner-Policello test)
  - new function CvM.test (two-sample Cramer-von Mises test)
  - new method for perm.t.test
  - new method for perm.var.test
  - new functions pcor and pcor.test (equivalents to cor and cor.test for (semi-)partial correlation)
  - new function pairwise.to.groups (conversion of a pairwise-comparison matrix to letters showing significantly different factor levels)
  - "mlm" models are now dealt properly by plotresid
  - pairwise.manova removed (dealt in a much powerful manner by the 'lsmeans' package)
  - new function pairwise.perm.manova (pairwise comparisons using permutational MANOVAs)
  - wald.ptheo.test accepts 2-column matrices as response
  - new function adonis.II (wrapper to adonis of the 'vegan' package but for type II tests)
  - new predict method for "coadisc" objects (Correspondence Discriminant Analysis performed with discrimin.coa from 'ade4')
  - DA.valid and DA.confusion can now handle "coadisc" objects (Correspondence Discriminant Analysis performed with discrimin.coa from 'ade4')
  - new arguments arrows in s.corcircle2
  - new function scat.cr ("correlation" of variables to axes in MCA or mix analyses)
  - MVA.synt extended to NSCA
  - wilcox.signtest now computes the confidence interval of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator (and this estimator)
  - new functions mood.medtest (Mood's median test) and pairwise.mood.medtest
  - new function prop.multinom.test (pairwise comparisons of proportions based on multinomial log-linear models)
  - wilcox.rating.signtest, wilcox.rating.test, kruskal.rating.test, friedman.rating.test, pairwise.wilcox.rating.test and wilcox.paired.rating.multcomp removed (these tests can be problematic with ratings, CLMs (package 'ordinal') are much better)
  - new function back.lsmeans (back-transformation of LSMeans and SE interval)
